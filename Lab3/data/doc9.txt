Under the name of Cuicul, the city was built 900 metres above sea level.
Thaw crab if frozen.Cut into serving-size pieces; crack.
The city was initially populated by a colony of Roman soldiers from Italy, and eventually grew to become a large trading market.
Arrange crab and vegetables on large platter or serving bowl.
I am looking for the email address of the World Health Organization.
Cooking broth may be ladled into cups and served as a soup after crab and vegetables are cooked.
